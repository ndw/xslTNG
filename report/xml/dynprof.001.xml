<para>This is an ordinary paragraph.</para>

<para condition="$not-test-harness">This document tests dynamic
profiling. The XSpec test harness configures several variables for
dynamic profiling that don’t otherwise exist in the stylesheets.
Consequently, the results you get if you process this document outside
the test harness will differ from the expected results.
This document was processed outside the test harness.</para>

profiling expression should raise an error. Consequently, this
paragraph should be included unless <parameter>$dynamic-profile-error</parameter>
